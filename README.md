This is a Tetris game I made with the intention of seeing what the console was capable of. The game features relaxing music, unicode character rewards, eye catching ascii art of big fat cats, and much more! The game starts off slow and relaxing, but as you clear lines and the speed increases it becomes quite challenging. If you'd like even more of a challenge, feel free to turn up the difficulty for yourself in the program file! Thanks for looking, and have fun

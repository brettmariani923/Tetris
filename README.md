This is a tetris game I made with the intention of seeing what the console was capable of. The game features relaxing music,
unicode charachter rewards, eye catching ascii art of big chunky cats, and much more! The game starts off slow and relaxing,
but as you clear lines the speed continues to increase and the game becomes quite challenging. But if you'd like more of a challenge, feel free to turn up the difficulty for yourself in the program file! Thanks for looking and I hope you like it!
